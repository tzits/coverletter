Hello Entefy, 


Iâ€™m a web developer in Palo Alto, and I am applying for the Web Application Developer position. I am interested in this position because I think this would be a fantastic opportunity to use my skills while also being in an environment where I can continue to learn and grow. I am eager to be a part of the team because I see both the need and the potential of Entefy. I have experienced the chaos Entefy seeks to rein in and think that Entefy could have a large role in shaping the future of social interaction.


Two of Entefy's core values are 'ethos' and 'environment', both of which are principles that I value. I prefer not to be a passive member of a group, instead taking initiative to create products I think will have a positive impact. For example, I created a Web App to help long distance hikers plan their gear selection, as I found myself lacking such a resource when I planned my hikes. As a developer and a former scientist, I also understand the intimacy and importance of an enthusiastic team environment and collaboration.

I would love to come in and further discuss my qualifications and what I can add to Entefy. Cheers,
Toby Zitsman

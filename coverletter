Hello HumanApi, 


Iâ€™m a web developer the Bay Area, and I am applying for the Front End Engineer position. I am interested in this position because I think this would be a fantastic opportunity to use my skills to make a difference while also being in an environment where I can continue to learn and grow. I am eager to be a part of the team because I understand both the need and the potential of HumanApi. I come from a healthcare background and have experienced how difficult it can be to access and share health data, even for small scale studies. HumanApi has an admirable goals to which I would be proud to contribute.


Two of HumanApi's core values are 'ownership' and 'teamwork', both of which are principles that I value. I strive to be proud of the work that I do, creating efficient yet elegant products. For example, I created a Web App to help long distance hikers plan their gear selection, as I found myself lacking such a resource when planning my own hikes. As a developer I also understand the intimacy and importance of an enthusiastic team environment, and have fond memories of debugging sessions on all of my petadoption being downright enjoyable due to the attitude and atmosphere I created with my teammates.

I would love to come in and further discuss my qualifications and what I can add to HumanApi. Cheers,
Toby Zitsman

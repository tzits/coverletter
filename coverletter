Hello Pill Club, 


Iâ€™m a web developer the Bay Area, and I am applying for the Frontend Software Engineer position. I am interested in this position because I think this would be a fantastic opportunity to use my skills to make a difference while also being in an environment where I can continue to learn and grow. I am eager to be a part of the team because I understand the importance of Pill Club now more than ever, and I want to do my part to contribute to its success. I come from a healthcare background and understand the frustrating and seemingly impersonal process of trying to get any sort of medication. Pill Club is doing something truly meaningful for our society and I would be proud to contribute.


Two of Pill Club's core values are 'simplicity' and 'empowerment', both of which are principles that I value. I strive to create simple, yet useful products. I developed a streamlined Web App, using MEAN stack, to help pet owners and adopters have easy access to pet information. As an open mind developer my goal is to empower my users with everything that I create. I also apply this principle to my beliefs. I do believe a woman should have control over her own body, and that's part of why Pill Club speaks to me so powerfully. I truly believe you are doing good. My apps embody this spirit as well. For example, I created a hiking app, using Ruby on Rails, which allows users to take ownership over what gear and preparation they take when planning long distance hikes. 

I would love to come in and further discuss my qualifications and what I can add to Pill Club. Cheers,
Toby Zitsman

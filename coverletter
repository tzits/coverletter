Hello Strava,


I’m a web developer in the bay area, and I am applying for the Web Software Engineering Intern position. I am interested in this position because I think this would be a fantastic opportunity to use my skills while also being in an environment where I can continue to learn and grow. I am really eager to be a part of the team because I am a Strava user and have seen firsthand how much your app has improved the industry in so short a time. Strava provides an amazing service to which I would be proud to contribute.


The company mission emphasizes the value of ‘strive’ and ‘community’, both of which are principles that I value. I try to push myself in all aspects of my life, be it tackling ambitious personal projects, such as the hiking gear app I recently developed using Ruby on Rails for the backend and Bootstrap for the styling, or by attempting increasingly difficult athletic achievements, such as hiking the Appalachian Trail. As an athlete and a developer, I also understand the intimacy and importance of a team environment and collaboration.


I would love to come in and further discuss my qualifications and what I can add to Strava. Cheers,
Toby Zitsman
